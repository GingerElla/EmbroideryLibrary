# ProcessingStitch
Processing code to visualize embroidery designs and create DST files.

## About:
This was originally created in the summer of 2015 as a supplementary tool for a code camp targeted at middle schoolers. Since then, there have been minor alteration and fixes, but we who started it (the Grinnell GLIMMER lab) no longer actively maintain and work on it, except when an event or activity calls for it. We hope you have fun using it and happy embroidering!

## How to use:
* If you have Processing 2.X.X, download the emroidery.jar file from ProcessingDemo, drag into the relevant Processing Sketch, and have fun :)
* If you have Processing 3.X.X, be prepared for some ugliness. This new version has broken the code in ways we do not fully understand yet. For now, download the processing-stitch.zip file from the ProcessingDemo folder, unzip its files in the (sketchfolder of the) relevant sketch, and be prepared for them to pop up as tabs in your .pde sketch. DO NOT MESS WITH THESE unless you are particularly brave--do all your coding in your .pde sketch. You may get weird errors. If you figure them out, let me know.
